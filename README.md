# PCE-Ribbon-Cable-Replacement
A clean and simple solution to replace the massive ribbon cable in the PCE and Core Grafx.

The Original PCE (white and the 2 CoreFrafx (blue and orange) remains beautiful hardware after all those years.
However they have one major imperfection. the card connector and the main PCB are connected by a huge ribbon cable. This Ribbon cable tends to oxidize and break like a sheet of paper when opening the console.

This is why I created a replacement using small PCBs and a single 45 pins FFC cable. The result is not only esthetically pleasing but also future proof.

CHALLENGES AND LIMITS OF THE SOLUTION

2.5mm pitch
Even though this is a relatively simple design the main challenge rest on the fact that the original Ribbon cable uses non-standard 2.5mm pitch when most of the hardware you can find out there is 2.54mm.
There is no magic solution. but it's relatively easy to overcome the issue using standard 2.54 pin array and slightly trimming them.

PCB over stepping
Second issue is that the new PCBs are facing each other when the shell is closed. There can be contacts between the pins on the cartridge connector and the motherboard. This can easily be fixed with a 0.6mm PCB, a good trim of the pin arrays and, to be absolutely safe, adding a layer of foam on the top or the bottom PCB.
